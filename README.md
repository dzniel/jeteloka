This repository contains my personal source code for a practicum project that I encountered during my study on Object-Oriented Programming course at [BINUS University](https://binus.ac.id).

## JeTeLoka
__JeTeLoka__ is a part of the lodging industry that has just experience a massive development growth. Because of that, they need someone to develop a program using Java as the programming language and MySQL for its storage data. Therefore, they also provided a database [query](https://github.com/dzniel/jeteloka/blob/main/jeteloka.sql) for us to start with.

## Summary
Throughout developing the program, I get to understand how I can use Object-Oriented Programming in developing a program. Moreover, I am also intrigued by the database connection through XAMPP Control Panel which enables storing and playing with data. Also applying the simplified [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) framework to better improve program maintenance, just in case.
